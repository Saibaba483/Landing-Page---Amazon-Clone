# Landing Page - Amazon Clone
This project is a simple Amazon landing page clone created using HTML and CSS only. The goal of this project was to practice and strengthen my front-end development skills by recreating the structure and design of one of the most popular e-commerce websites in the world.

The landing page is fully static and does not include any backend functionality such as authentication, cart system, or payment gateway. It is mainly focused on the layout, styling, and design aspects that give a similar look and feel to Amazon’s homepage.


Features:

Header Section: Contains the Amazon logo, navigation menu, and a search bar styled to look like the original.

Navigation Bar: Includes links such as Today’s Deals, Customer Service, Registry, and more for a realistic structure.

Hero Section: A large banner image designed with proper background styling, giving the homepage a professional and attractive appearance.

Product Sections: Different sections display product categories in grid layouts, including items like electronics, fashion, home essentials, and more.

Footer Section: A simple footer that contains useful links, policies, and a back-to-top option to improve user navigation.


Technologies Used:

HTML5 – for structuring the content, headings, paragraphs, images, and links.

CSS3 – for styling the elements, applying background colors, margins, paddings, grid/flexbox layouts, hover effects, and responsive design.


Learning Outcomes:

By working on this project, I learned how to:

Break down a complex website layout into smaller sections.

Use flexbox and CSS grid for creating responsive layouts.

Apply consistent styling, spacing, and alignment to make the page visually appealing.

Improve my ability to clone real-world website designs for practice.


Future Improvements:

Making the page fully responsive for mobile and tablet devices.

Adding JavaScript functionality for interactive features like dropdown menus or carousels.

Extending it into a full e-commerce clone with backend integration in the future.

This project is purely for educational purposes and is not affiliated with Amazon.
